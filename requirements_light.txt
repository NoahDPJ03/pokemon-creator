# Deployment requirements for Streamlit Cloud
# Core ML and web app dependencies only - AI features disabled for stability
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0

# Note: AI generation dependencies (torch, diffusers, transformers) 
# removed for deployment stability. Complete AI code preserved in Modeling.py
# but commented out due to Streamlit Cloud memory limitations.

# For local development with full AI features, use requirements.txt instead
